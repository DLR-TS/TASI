## Notes

* Windows users may have to install fiona manually since there is
  no pre-build wheel for windows on PyPi. Just download and install the wheels for windows version `amd_64` and python
  version 3.8 from [GDAL](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal) and
  [fiona](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona) with `pip`. *Note that windows is not officially supported.*
