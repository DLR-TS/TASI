^^^^^^^^^^
TASI Code
^^^^^^^^^^

Select an open issue which is not assigned to a colleague (see `GitLab issue board
<https://gitlab.dlr.de/infrastructure/tasi/-/boards/857>`_)

* Assign issue to yourself
* Create a new local branch and start development
* Add tests to verify the functionality of your content
* Push local branch to GitLab on a new remote branch
* Create a merge-request and describe what this commit will change
* Wait for the merge request to be approved. Discuss changes with colleague in merge-request

Something is missing or you've found a bug? Create a new issue!

* Check whether there is a template for your kind of issue.
* If there is a template available use it and fill in the required information.
* If there is no template available add the label "needs-approval" to the issue. You will be notified when your issue has been approved by a project member.
