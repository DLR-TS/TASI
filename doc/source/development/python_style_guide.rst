Python style guide definition
=============================

To guarantee that all python modules and applications of the `tasi` follow the same style guide, auto-formatting should
be activated in the projects (see the official  `Visual Studio Code
documentation <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting>`_).

For Visual Studio Code the code formatter `yapf` is used since it respects the `google
format <http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>`_. This format should be used on all applications due to to its
simplicity. Furthermore, you are encouraged to use the `typing <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>`_ module
extensively.
