Contribution
###############

There are many ways to contribute to ``tasi`` and we would really appreciate if you want to help us build a software tool that helps to make our live working with traffic data easier! 

Problems and errors
********************

First of all, if you find a problem with something ``tasi`` related, please raise an issue in `GitHub <https://github.com/dlr-ts/tasi/issues>`_. The same holds for any question that you might have. We might provide are more direct link to the ``tasi`` developers in the future.


Examples
********************

We would like to integrate your use-cases and examples in the documentation that might help others in the future. So, please create an issue in `GitHub <https://github.com/dlr-ts/tasi/issues>`_ with your example and let's discuss together how to integrate this into ``tasi`` and showcase real-world applications.


Documentation
********************

The documentation is the first step into a new python library. That's why we build our documentation based on the `PyData Sphinx Theme <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ that is used by `numpy`_ and `pandas`_. If you want to contribute to the documentation, please have a look into the theme's `documentation <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/index.html>`_ and help us make the documentation a useful piece of ``tasi``.
