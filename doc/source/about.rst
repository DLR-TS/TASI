About TASI
############

In our daily work with traffic data, we identified a need for a toolset that would allow us to apply algorithms and methods to different variants of traffic data. At the DLR `Institute of Transportation Systems`_, specifically within the `Information Acquisition and Model Design`_ department, we utilize a multitude of sources for traffic data, including (semi-)stationary infrastructure and vehicles, as well as data from research projects such as `VVMethod`_. 

Rather than developing algorithms over and over again, we wanted to create a toolset that could be utilized irrespective of the data source and that would enable others to replicate results due to a common and solid foundation. This vision consituted the genesis of our endeavor to develop ``TASI``.

Over the past few years, we have invested a significant amount of time and effort into developing the current stage of ``TASI``. While the primary objective of this public version of ``TASI`` is to provide access to the datasets from our Test Beds, our DLR internal version is already equipped with a multitude of functions, algorithms and interfaces around traffic data management, analysis and exchange. We want to make as much as possible readily accessible to others in the future, so that ``TASI`` will potentially become a toolkit that others find useful. However, we want to ensure that the code quality is solid, the documentation is helpful and overall the library is in a good shape. Therefore, parts of the DLR internal version will be shipped out continuously in the future.
