Getting started

Hi there and welcome to the getting started guide of ``tasi`` 👋😀 This page shall help to get started right away with
instructions on how to install ``tasi`` and a description of the main ``tasi`` concepts. You may visit the following links
one after another. Note that the sections may contain links to external pages. It is recommended to visit those links
before continuing. If you have any questions regarding ``tasi``, feel free raise an issue. Happy reading 😁

Since ``tasi`` uses ``pandas`` under the hood, head over to the official `pandas
User Guide <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html>`_. Afterwards, you may head over to the :ref:`User
Guide <_user_guide>` for some use-case related examples using
``tasi``. If you want to contribute to ``tasi``, visit :ref:`Development Documentation
<_development>` for further instructions.
